# Work Dispatch Index

Start here. This file is the only live dispatch queue.

For the operating rules, prompt templates, and handoff format, read
`docs/work/operating-model.md`.

## Queue Rules

- A worker should execute only rows with `Status: ready`.
- The target is three to five `ready` rows whenever validated work exists.
- When fewer than three remain at a dispatch boundary, the coordinator
  replenishes the complete slate in one pass.
- A below-target slate must name the decision, blocker, or shortage of validated
  candidates preventing replenishment.
- More than five `ready` rows requires an explicitly requested larger execution
  batch.
- `needs_decision` rows are coordinator work: resolve the decision, then promote
  enough source-backed work to restore the rolling slate, or leave the missing
  decision named.
- `blocked` rows need external evidence or a product decision. Do not code around
  them.
- Workers claim the highest-ranked compatible `ready` row and leave other
  executable rows available.
- Dependent, deferred, rejected, blocked, and unverified work cannot be used as
  queue-depth filler.
- `active` rows are already owned by a named worker or branch. Do not start a
  second worker on them unless the coordinator reassigns the row.
- Completed lanes do not stay in this queue. Their history remains in the lane
  work doc and dated plan archive.

## Current Queue

Updated: 2026-07-09

The 2026-06-29 usable-product batch is complete. It moved the shopper decision
loop forward across product browse cards, product detail actions, compare
selection, offer filter context, and saved-comparison return paths.

The first explicitly requested parallel batch from the product filtering and
in-depth comparison plan set is complete. Backend filter metadata/facets and
frontend compare matrix modes landed in separate commits with focused
verification.

The full product filtering and in-depth comparison plan set is complete.
Persistent Compare Tray work is complete through
`871fecb docs: record persistent compare tray verification`, and the compare,
catalog, and detail lane docs record the completed evidence.

The CJ read-model and weekly operator-runbook batch is complete. The merchant
identity quality read model, application readiness read model, and weekly
operator runbook landed on the current stack and have completion evidence in
`docs/work/product-data-scraping.md`.

The product-facing follow-up batch is complete. It used existing frontend
routes and GraphQL contracts, avoided CJ ingestion surfaces, and kept
backend/schema work out of scope.

The explicitly requested revenue readiness, shopper UX polish, and backend
quality parallel batch is complete. It added first-party tracked commerce
clicks, `/offers` visible merchant quick filters, and deterministic invalid
Relay connection page-size errors without reopening deferred eBay, ingestion
dashboard/operator, live provider, credential, application submission, Tier-3
scraping, or CSV export work.

The product-facing curation direction was selected on 2026-07-08. The next
batch stays on shopper-facing catalog and offer-discovery surfaces, avoids
deferred ingestion/eBay/operator work, and uses current app contracts as the
source of truth.

That product-facing curation batch is complete. Catalog search and sorting plus
offer-discovery product label context have green completion evidence in their
lane work docs dated 2026-07-09.

Shopper decision confidence was selected and completed on 2026-07-09. Catalog
result guidance, offer observation and coupon validity, product-detail price
observation, and the visible-page offer snapshot all have green completion
evidence in their lane docs. No additional validated candidate is available;
the remaining catalogued work is deferred or rejected and cannot be used as
queue filler.

On 2026-07-10, a user-reported GraphQL request-waterfall audit produced one
validated cross-stack performance batch. It is active below. No other validated
candidate is available, so the ready slate remains below target rather than
being filled with deferred or rejected work.

## Ready Work

None. The only newly validated batch is already active, and the plan catalog
contains no additional validated candidate outside deferred or rejected work.

## Active Work

### GraphQL request waterfall elimination

Status: active
Lane: Frontend GraphQL route data with supporting backend schema contracts
Owner: current Codex worker
Next action: Implement the approved design with failing request-count and pagination tests first.
Owned paths: `lib/product_compare/catalog.ex`, `lib/product_compare/pricing.ex`, `lib/product_compare_web/schema.ex`, `lib/product_compare_web/resolvers/catalog_resolver.ex`, `lib/product_compare_web/resolvers/pricing_resolver.ex`, `test/product_compare_web/graphql/**`, `assets/schema.graphql`, `assets/src/routes/compare/**`, `assets/src/routes/products/**`, `assets/src/routes/catalog/**`, `assets/src/routes/account/api-tokens/**`, `assets/src/__generated__/**`, matching frontend tests, and `docs/work/frontend-graphql-request-waterfalls.md`
Verification: Focused GraphQL and frontend tests; Relay generation; `cd assets && bun run check`; `mix test`; `mix typecheck`; `git diff --check`
Exit condition: The three combined-data routes make one initial GraphQL request each, eager pagination is removed from saved comparisons and API tokens, verification passes, and the lane is closed with evidence.

## Needs Decision Work

None. Shopper decision confidence was selected on 2026-07-09.

## Blocked Work

None.

## Just Completed

The 2026-07-09 shopper decision-confidence batch completed catalog result
guidance: `/products` now shows the complete metadata-backed result count and
scoped active-filter removal links that preserve unrelated filters, page size,
and compare selections while dropping stale cursors. Focused verification
passed 58 tests plus TypeScript and diff checks.

The same batch completed offer observation and coupon validity context:
`/offers` now shows supported offer-check, latest-price observation, and coupon
expiration dates with semantic time markup while omitting missing or malformed
date claims. Relay generation, 46 focused tests, TypeScript, and diff checks
passed.

The same batch completed product-detail price observation context:
`/products/:slug` now shows supported latest-price observation dates while
leaving prices and existing offer behavior intact for missing or malformed
timestamps. Relay generation, 45 focused tests, TypeScript, and diff checks
passed.

The same batch completed the visible offer snapshot: `/offers` now summarizes
the safe, renderable page with visible counts and a single-currency lowest-price
signal, refuses mixed-currency comparisons, and omits the summary for empty or
unsafe-only pages. Focused verification passed 49 tests plus TypeScript and diff
checks.

The 2026-07-08 product-facing curation batch completed these work items:

- Catalog browse and backend catalog: `/products` now supports bounded text
  search and deterministic sorting through URL state while preserving filters,
  pagination, and compare selections.
- Offer discovery: `/offers` now shows selected-product name, optional brand,
  and detail navigation while preserving existing filter and offer behavior.
- Both lane work docs record green focused tests, Relay generation where
  applicable, TypeScript verification, and clean diff checks dated 2026-07-09.

The 2026-07-08 parallel execution batch completed these work items:

- Revenue readiness and shopper UX: product detail and `/offers` merchant
  actions now use a first-party `trackCommerceClick(input:)` GraphQL mutation
  that accepts only `merchantProductId`, resolves destinations server-side, and
  returns relative `/r/:click_id` redirect paths.
- Offer discovery UX: `/offers` now exposes visible merchant quick filters from
  loaded offer rows, preserves route-local filters, and drops stale cursors when
  applying a merchant filter.
- Backend quality: shared Relay connection pagination now rejects invalid
  `first` values with deterministic `invalid first` GraphQL errors while
  preserving default, clamp, `first: 0`, and malformed cursor behavior.

The 2026-07-03 product-facing follow-up batch completed these five work items:

- Frontend catalog browse: `/products` cards now show bounded current-spec
  teasers from the existing `Product.currentAttributes` contract.
- Frontend product detail: `/products/:slug` now summarizes the visible
  active-offer page with loaded-offer count, lowest visible price, coupon
  availability, and missing-price count.
- Frontend offer discovery: `/offers` now preserves route-local sort controls
  through filters and pagination and applies sort-specific labels to the first
  visible numeric price result.
- Frontend saved comparisons: `/compare/saved` now sorts loaded saved sets by
  current order, name, and product count while preserving filter, reopen, and
  delete behavior.
- Frontend merchant discovery: `/merchants` now renders safe merchant website
  links while leaving unsafe domains as text.

The CJ read-model and weekly operator-runbook batch is complete and no longer
live queue work. The lane evidence records final gates for:

- CJ candidate cohort.
- CJ candidate market coverage.
- CJ candidate freshness.
- CJ run health.
- CJ run throughput.
- CJ import artifact quality.
- CJ import price quality.
- CJ merchant identity quality.
- CJ application readiness.
- CJ weekly operator runbook.

The 2026-06-30 first product filtering and in-depth comparison parallel batch
and dependent catalog UI follow-up completed these work items:

- Backend filter metadata/facets: GraphQL now exposes
  `productFilterMetadata(filters:)` with display-safe counts, ranges, selected
  state, and typed filter validation using the existing `ProductFiltersInput`.
- Frontend product comparison: `/compare` now supports URL-backed
  `specs=shared|differences|all` matrix modes with mode-preserving add/remove
  links and explicit missing values.
- Frontend catalog browse: `/products` now renders metadata-backed faceted
  filters, preserves active filter URLs through pagination, and clears back to
  the unfiltered browse page.
- Compare attribute metadata: `Product.currentAttributes` now includes typed,
  ordered, groupable metadata used by product detail and compare rendering while
  preserving the `valueText` fallback contract.
- Compare offer decision helpers: `/compare` now renders a bounded, resilient
  decision summary for current price and offer quality using the existing
  `merchantProducts(input:)` pricing contract.

The 2026-06-29 usable-product batch completed these five work items:

- Frontend catalog browse: `/products` product decision cards with stable
  detail, compare, and offer actions.
- Frontend product detail: `/products/:slug` next-action block for compare,
  offer review, and browse return.
- Frontend product comparison: `/compare` selected-product tray and add-another
  affordance.
- Frontend offer discovery: `/offers` active filter context, reset actions, and
  product-selection guidance.
- Frontend saved comparisons: `/compare/saved` card summaries, scoped actions,
  and empty/no-match return links.

The 2026-06-27 cross-project parallel batch completed these ten work items:

- Frontend catalog browse: `/products` page-size controls.
- Frontend product detail: `/products/:slug` active-offer pagination.
- Frontend offer discovery: visible `/offers` filters.
- Frontend merchant discovery: `/merchants` page-size controls.
- Frontend revenue reporting: deterministic date preset links.
- Frontend saved comparisons: client-side saved-set filtering.
- Frontend product comparison: compare-selection remove controls.
- Frontend API token management: create/rotate expiration presets.
- Frontend affiliate setup: selected merchant context summaries.
- Product data scraping: provider-neutral source-health read model.

## Retained Follow-Up Work

Application submission, account-manager contact, Tier-3 scraping, credential
persistence, and CSV export remain out of scope. CJ candidate CSV score export
is rejected and should not be promoted. eBay Browse fallback is deferred by
product decision as of 2026-07-08 and should not be promoted until that decision
is reversed. Ingestion dashboard and operator surfaces are also deferred by
product decision as of 2026-07-08.

## Executor Prompts

Coordinator:

```text
Start at docs/work/index.md.

Read docs/work/operating-model.md.
Process the highest-ranked non-ready row when a decision or blocker exists.
Otherwise curate source-backed candidates from docs/plans/INDEX.md and the directly affected lane docs.
When fewer than three ready rows remain, replenish the slate to three to five ready rows in one pass.
Validate every promoted row's owned paths, verification, prerequisites, and exit condition.
Update only the live queue plus the directly affected lane or plan docs.
End with three to five ready rows, or every valid row plus a clearly named reason the slate is smaller.
```

Worker:

```text
Start at docs/work/index.md.

Read docs/work/operating-model.md.
Execute only the highest-ranked row whose Status is ready and that does not conflict with an active row.
Leave other ready rows unchanged.
Open only that row's Work Doc, linked active plan if any, Target Paths, and immediate tests.
Update the lane work doc as the batch changes.
Do not edit coordinator-owned docs unless the ready row names them as Target Paths.
Stop if the row is blocked, stale, or needs a decision.
```

## Completed Work

Completed lane summaries remain in their lane work docs under `docs/work/*.md`.
Dated implementation plans remain under `docs/plans/`. They are historical
reference unless this queue links one as the active plan for a `ready` row.
