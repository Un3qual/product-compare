# Work Dispatch Index

Start here. This file is the only live dispatch queue.

For the operating rules, prompt templates, and handoff format, read
`docs/work/operating-model.md`.

## Queue Rules

- A worker should execute only rows with `Status: ready`.
- If no `ready` row exists, do not scan historical plans looking for work.
- `needs_decision` rows are coordinator work: make one decision, then promote exactly
  one concrete `ready` row or one explicitly requested parallel batch of independent
  ready rows, remove the decision row so the selected `blocked` row becomes
  highest-ranked, or leave the missing decision named.
- `blocked` rows need external evidence or a product decision. Do not code around
  them.
- `active` rows are already owned by a named worker or branch. Do not start a
  second worker on them unless the coordinator reassigns the row.
- Completed lanes do not stay in this queue. Their history remains in the lane
  work doc and dated plan archive.

## Current Queue

Updated: 2026-07-08

The 2026-06-29 usable-product batch is complete. It moved the shopper decision
loop forward across product browse cards, product detail actions, compare
selection, offer filter context, and saved-comparison return paths.

The first explicitly requested parallel batch from the product filtering and
in-depth comparison plan set is complete. Backend filter metadata/facets and
frontend compare matrix modes landed in separate commits with focused
verification.

The full product filtering and in-depth comparison plan set is complete.
Persistent Compare Tray work is complete through
`871fecb docs: record persistent compare tray verification`, and the compare,
catalog, and detail lane docs record the completed evidence.

The CJ read-model and weekly operator-runbook batch is complete. The merchant
identity quality read model, application readiness read model, and weekly
operator runbook landed on the current stack and have completion evidence in
`docs/work/product-data-scraping.md`.

The product-facing follow-up batch is complete. It used existing frontend
routes and GraphQL contracts, avoided CJ ingestion surfaces, and kept
backend/schema work out of scope.

The next explicitly requested parallel batch is active. It covers revenue
readiness, shopper UX polish, and backend quality without reopening deferred
eBay, ingestion dashboard/operator, live provider, credential, application
submission, Tier-3 scraping, or CSV export work.

## Ready Work

### Commerce Offer Interaction Batch

Status: active
Lane: Revenue readiness and shopper UX
Owner: Codex commerce/offers worker
Next action: Implement first-party tracked outbound commerce clicks for
existing product/offer surfaces and make `/offers` merchant filtering
discoverable from visible offer rows.
Owned paths: `lib/product_compare/commerce_attribution.ex`,
`lib/product_compare_web/resolvers/commerce_attribution_resolver.ex`,
`lib/product_compare_web/schema.ex`, commerce attribution and GraphQL tests,
`assets/schema.graphql`, `assets/src/routes/products/**`,
`assets/src/routes/offers/**`, related product/offers route tests,
`docs/work/affiliate-revenue-attribution.md`, and
`docs/work/frontend-offer-discovery-demo-parity.md`.
Verification: focused commerce attribution/controller/GraphQL tests,
`cd assets && bun run relay`, focused product/offers Vitest route tests,
`cd assets && bun run typecheck`, and `git diff --check`.
Exit condition: offer/product outbound actions use first-party
`/r/:click_id` redirects without accepting raw browser-provided destinations,
`/offers` supports visible merchant quick filters that preserve existing URL
state and drop stale cursors, and lane docs record evidence.

### GraphQL Connection Contract Hardening

Status: active
Lane: Backend quality
Owner: Codex backend-quality worker
Next action: Harden shared Relay connection pagination so invalid `first`
values, especially negative integers, return a deterministic GraphQL error
instead of silently falling back to the default page size while preserving
default, max clamp, `first: 0`, and malformed cursor behavior.
Owned paths: `lib/product_compare_web/graphql/connection.ex`, focused GraphQL
connection tests and shipped connection-surface tests under
`test/product_compare_web/graphql/**`, and
`docs/work/backend-graphql-connection-contract-hardening.md`.
Verification: focused connection and shipped connection-surface GraphQL tests,
`mix typecheck`, and `git diff --check`.
Exit condition: all shipped connection surfaces reject invalid page sizes
consistently, existing cursor/default/clamp behavior still passes, and the lane
doc records evidence.

## Blocked Work

None.

## Just Completed

The 2026-07-03 product-facing follow-up batch completed these five work items:

- Frontend catalog browse: `/products` cards now show bounded current-spec
  teasers from the existing `Product.currentAttributes` contract.
- Frontend product detail: `/products/:slug` now summarizes the visible
  active-offer page with loaded-offer count, lowest visible price, coupon
  availability, and missing-price count.
- Frontend offer discovery: `/offers` now preserves route-local sort controls
  through filters and pagination and applies sort-specific labels to the first
  visible numeric price result.
- Frontend saved comparisons: `/compare/saved` now sorts loaded saved sets by
  current order, name, and product count while preserving filter, reopen, and
  delete behavior.
- Frontend merchant discovery: `/merchants` now renders safe merchant website
  links while leaving unsafe domains as text.

The CJ read-model and weekly operator-runbook batch is complete and no longer
live queue work. The lane evidence records final gates for:

- CJ candidate cohort.
- CJ candidate market coverage.
- CJ candidate freshness.
- CJ run health.
- CJ run throughput.
- CJ import artifact quality.
- CJ import price quality.
- CJ merchant identity quality.
- CJ application readiness.
- CJ weekly operator runbook.

The 2026-06-30 first product filtering and in-depth comparison parallel batch
and dependent catalog UI follow-up completed these work items:

- Backend filter metadata/facets: GraphQL now exposes
  `productFilterMetadata(filters:)` with display-safe counts, ranges, selected
  state, and typed filter validation using the existing `ProductFiltersInput`.
- Frontend product comparison: `/compare` now supports URL-backed
  `specs=shared|differences|all` matrix modes with mode-preserving add/remove
  links and explicit missing values.
- Frontend catalog browse: `/products` now renders metadata-backed faceted
  filters, preserves active filter URLs through pagination, and clears back to
  the unfiltered browse page.
- Compare attribute metadata: `Product.currentAttributes` now includes typed,
  ordered, groupable metadata used by product detail and compare rendering while
  preserving the `valueText` fallback contract.
- Compare offer decision helpers: `/compare` now renders a bounded, resilient
  decision summary for current price and offer quality using the existing
  `merchantProducts(input:)` pricing contract.

The 2026-06-29 usable-product batch completed these five work items:

- Frontend catalog browse: `/products` product decision cards with stable
  detail, compare, and offer actions.
- Frontend product detail: `/products/:slug` next-action block for compare,
  offer review, and browse return.
- Frontend product comparison: `/compare` selected-product tray and add-another
  affordance.
- Frontend offer discovery: `/offers` active filter context, reset actions, and
  product-selection guidance.
- Frontend saved comparisons: `/compare/saved` card summaries, scoped actions,
  and empty/no-match return links.

The 2026-06-27 cross-project parallel batch completed these ten work items:

- Frontend catalog browse: `/products` page-size controls.
- Frontend product detail: `/products/:slug` active-offer pagination.
- Frontend offer discovery: visible `/offers` filters.
- Frontend merchant discovery: `/merchants` page-size controls.
- Frontend revenue reporting: deterministic date preset links.
- Frontend saved comparisons: client-side saved-set filtering.
- Frontend product comparison: compare-selection remove controls.
- Frontend API token management: create/rotate expiration presets.
- Frontend affiliate setup: selected merchant context summaries.
- Product data scraping: provider-neutral source-health read model.

## Retained Follow-Up Work

Application submission, account-manager contact, Tier-3 scraping, credential
persistence, and CSV export remain out of scope. CJ candidate CSV score export
is rejected and should not be promoted. eBay Browse fallback is deferred by
product decision as of 2026-07-08 and should not be promoted until that decision
is reversed. Ingestion dashboard and operator surfaces are also deferred by
product decision as of 2026-07-08.

## Executor Prompts

Coordinator:

```text
Start at docs/work/index.md.

Read docs/work/operating-model.md.
Process the highest-ranked non-ready row.
Make exactly one decision or unblock exactly one blocker.
Update only the live queue plus the directly affected lane or plan docs.
End with either one ready row or a clearly named blocker.
```

Worker:

```text
Start at docs/work/index.md.

Read docs/work/operating-model.md.
Execute only the highest-ranked row whose Status is ready.
Open only that row's Work Doc, linked active plan if any, Target Paths, and immediate tests.
Update the lane work doc as the batch changes.
Do not edit coordinator-owned docs unless the ready row names them as Target Paths.
Stop if the row is blocked, stale, or needs a decision.
```

## Completed Work

Completed lane summaries remain in their lane work docs under `docs/work/*.md`.
Dated implementation plans remain under `docs/plans/`. They are historical
reference unless this queue links one as the active plan for a `ready` row.
