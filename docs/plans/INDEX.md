# Plan Index

Start at `docs/work/index.md` for live execution status. This file is a catalog
of active and candidate plans, not the dispatch queue.

## Active Architecture Sources

## Active Plan Catalog

The Product data scraping lane has one explicitly requested parallel batch of
ten ready work-item plans. Start at `docs/work/index.md` for dispatch order and
target paths.

| ready | `docs/plans/2026-06-27-cj-merchant-identity-quality-read-model-implementation-plan.md` | Read-only CJ merchant identity quality read model; no Mix task. |
| ready | `docs/plans/2026-06-27-cj-application-readiness-read-model-implementation-plan.md` | Read-only CJ application readiness read model; no Mix task or application action. |
| ready | `docs/plans/2026-06-27-cj-weekly-operator-runbook-implementation-plan.md` | Docs-only weekly operator runbook using existing commands. |

Rejected: CJ candidate CSV score export was explicitly removed from the scoring
batch and should not be recreated or promoted.

## Candidate Pool

| Status | Candidate | Create Or Promote When | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| blocked | eBay Browse fallback connector | CJ validation records that the approved CJ account lacks usable product catalog scope. | Create the fallback plan from the CJ decision evidence rather than guessing before the blocker resolves. |
